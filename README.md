# :sparkles::sparkles::sparkles: React WooCommerce

## Overview

This project is the version 2 of my original [React eCommerce project](https://github.com/loq24/react-ecommerce). This version implements ISR or the Incremental Static Regeneration mode of NextJS framework. Instead of REST API, this project is powered by GraphQL via Apollo Client and WPGraphQL which is a plugin for the Wordpress Headless CMS. I am also using WooGraphQL to query WooCommerce data using GraphQL.

## Setup

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/
